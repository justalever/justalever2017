is the home of expert video tutorials and courses showcasing [Affinity-Serif products](https://affinity.serif.com) such as [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/), [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/), and Affinity Publisher (*coming soon*).\n\n### The goal\n\nThe idea of the application is to build a community around Affinity-Serif software as Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo have been my go-to applications for photo editing and vector design. There are other apps in the ecosystem for designers to use (Adobe, Sketch, Figma, etc...) but I found that the market share of Affinity\'s products is rather small. That being said I saw an opportunity to shed some more light on the applications as well as maybe monetize from the process.\n\n### How it works\n\n+ Videos and courses will be authored in a constant fashion of which will be both free and premium. Premium videos can be viewed if a user has subscribed to a monthly plan at Affinicasts. \n+ To start I would be the primary author of the courses and videos\n+ A user can sign up and create a free account or they can subscribe to a premium account to gain access to all videos and courses throughout the site.\n\n### Why Affinicasts?\n\nI like using Affinity software. I prefer it over Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (even though I still make use of those apps too). My goal with Affinicasts is to share how I use the applications, show off features within each and share some tips and tricks when designing with the software. I also took on this project to learn a web development framework called [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). I learned a lot about frontend and backend development along the way so the process was very valuable to me. \n\n### The Design\nThe design of Affinicasts is quite minimal but also illustrative. I added illustrations throughout to ease the minimal feel but not so much as to distract the user. The primary focus are the videos and courses so I wanted those to stand apart from the rest. \n\n#### The Homepage\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/66U3b24lAQUaeUUASoYAEQ/0b9a57a1f2d25b30555ba6eb285053fd/affinicasts-home.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/66U3b24lAQUaeUUASoYAEQ/0b9a57a1f2d25b30555ba6eb285053fd/affinicasts-home.jpg" alt="Affinicasts Home Page" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n#### Videos page\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/nSr03WxLCoGgyuQ4Gcca4/55c8c7a9a7dae2e762b26dc0ef7254af/affinicasts-videos.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/nSr03WxLCoGgyuQ4Gcca4/55c8c7a9a7dae2e762b26dc0ef7254af/affinicasts-videos.jpg" alt="Affinicasts Videos Page" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n#### Course landing page\n\nA course index is shown on each course landing page to offer insight on what the course entails along with any assets that may be available for download. Pro level courses are disabled from showing for unsubscribed users. A "Go Pro" button displays instead of the "Start Course" button that would otherwise be shown on free courses.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6ML0yLfvFeiMwg2ws2W60s/949c3537ad838ba0cfe50301e35dad0d/affinicasts-course-landing.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6ML0yLfvFeiMwg2ws2W60s/949c3537ad838ba0cfe50301e35dad0d/affinicasts-course-landing.jpg" alt="Affinicasts Course Landing Page" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n#### Pricing page\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5fG0rzgR7aYWueKagS8eai/53232e62e5e1285ad6d35c2ad422b215/affinicasts-pricing.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5fG0rzgR7aYWueKagS8eai/53232e62e5e1285ad6d35c2ad422b215/affinicasts-pricing.jpg" alt="Affinicasts Pricing Page" />\n</a>\n\n#### Single lesson page\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5DfwmSCElGImcUgYyCkqic/ec872c5c759cc13978543f4c0f973ef5/affinicasts-individual-lesson.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5DfwmSCElGImcUgYyCkqic/ec872c5c759cc13978543f4c0f973ef5/affinicasts-individual-lesson.jpg" alt="Affinicasts Individual Lesson Page" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n#### Blog\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6gZG3xazIcU80uikwOI6Ec/99ec6ae578b4b1fa84bcbc1e23f3d2dc/affinicasts-blog.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6gZG3xazIcU80uikwOI6Ec/99ec6ae578b4b1fa84bcbc1e23f3d2dc/affinicasts-blog.jpg" alt="Affinicasts Blog" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n### A completely custom admin area\n\nA large part of the site is coded with the admin user in mind. In this case, the admin user is only me and has to be added by hand from the command line. I avoided making an entire flow for this process as I will be the primary maintainer of the application. In a real-world scenario, I may want to explore creating a UI for this specific experience so new admin level users can be added easily.\n\nThe admin user level enables further control as a user is logged in. As an admin, I can create new videos, courses, resources, and blog posts as shown at the very top of the preceding images. I built a customized CMS upon the application of which I can use the [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) approach to any new content that gets added to the site.  \n\n#### User dashboard\n\nWhen a user who has registered logs in they are redirected to their own personal dashboard. Here the user can see any saved videos they have added to their watch list, recently added videos, recently added courses, and an activity timeline which shows any activity to already published videos and courses.\n\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/7gqEKCJwbKE6sSKouKQCs0/f48cd10ca4f07a5f119354ccc211aa12/affinicasts-user-profile-dashboard.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/7gqEKCJwbKE6sSKouKQCs0/f48cd10ca4f07a5f119354ccc211aa12/affinicasts-user-profile-dashboard.jpg" alt="Affinicasts User Profile Dashboard" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n#### User account\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3pSNs44g4oy80sUOkm2kYa/a945c974f70b789aca7f1a00cdf153e9/affinicasts-user-profile-profile.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3pSNs44g4oy80sUOkm2kYa/a945c974f70b789aca7f1a00cdf153e9/affinicasts-user-profile-profile.jpg" alt="Affinicasts User Profile" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n#### Subscribed User Membership Page\n\nIf a user is subscribed to the pro plan they will see information about their subscription as well as the ability to update their credit card on file. A user can unsubscribe or resubscribe at any time.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/2QARefY3Ac6a0wqgMGe884/3f72024aad0c2b9eb940b76f9fe35215/affinicasts-user-profile-membership.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/2QARefY3Ac6a0wqgMGe884/3f72024aad0c2b9eb940b76f9fe35215/affinicasts-user-profile-membership.jpg" alt="Affinicasts User Profile Membership" />\n</a>\n\n---\n\n### Admin level pages\n\nAn admin user has more options available in the top navigation bar that displays once that user role logs into their respected account.\n\n#### Creating a video\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4e7A5RrEcw0Uq0w4G8qci4/f2bb554368439be5d6672d4b5216bb5e/affinicasts-create-video.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4e7A5RrEcw0Uq0w4G8qci4/f2bb554368439be5d6672d4b5216bb5e/affinicasts-create-video.jpg" alt="Creating a video" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### Creating a course\n\nCreating a course is very similar to a video, only the admin user can add multiple videos within the course creation experience that relate to the said course.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/eG3rbZGfYsyegy40k0S8G/b5201ae71d7e10bbc2b44de251ac0e65/affinicasts-create-course.jpg" class="view-fullsize" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/eG3rbZGfYsyegy40k0S8G/b5201ae71d7e10bbc2b44de251ac0e65/affinicasts-create-course.jpg" alt="Creating a course" />\n</a>\n\n\n\n## Incorporating the SaaS model\n\nAs I said before, users can choose to subscribe to Affinicasts by paying a monthly subscription fee via Stripe to access premium content. There\'s only one plan in place at this time but I may shift this model to add a "lump sum" type of payment since Affinity software itself doesn\'t use the SaaS model. This is still something that needs to be tested with users. This *non-SaaS* approach is why a lot of folks jumped of Adobe and onboard to Affinity software. \n\n#### How we collect payments\n\nTo create an account a user can at any time click a "Go Pro" call to action on the site and or the "Join Affinicasts" button on the pricing page. The guest is then redirected to a Signup form where they provide a username/email, and password. Once their account is created they will be redirected to an internal subscription page where the actual payment details get processed and passed through to Stripe. At no time do we save any payment details at Affinicasts.com as that would be an extremely large security flaw. \n\n\n## The Technology Stack\n\nThe entire application is built on the Ruby on Rails framework. At its core, the code involves, you guessed it, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails). Ruby is a delightful language that is very readable and easy to understand. I could have built this application using another framework like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (`PHP`) or even no framework at all but I found Ruby on Rails to be the most straightforward approach since I\'ve only had experience with mainly frontend development up until that point. \n\nRuby on Rails is rather opinionated but it does cover nearly all the basics you need to run a fully-fledged web application. Some big names make use of Ruby on Rails or have had in the past including [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), [Github](https://github.com), [Shopify](https://shopify.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), and more. \n\nSome developers today have since switched to more modern stacks that rely more on JavaScript for both frontend and backend but that didn\'t sway me for this project. If my application needed to scale fast then I may consider reauthoring it inside another type of ecosystem. \n\nTL;DR;\n\n#### The summarized stack\n\n+ Affinicasts is built on Ruby on Rails.\n+ The app is hosted on Heroku.com.\n+ The app uses SendGrid for transactional emails.\n+ Stripe is used for payment gateways.\n+ Sass/CSS are used for styles.\n+ Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.\n+ Vimeo for video hosting - A pro plan\n+ AWS for asset hosting - Images, art files for download, resources, etc...\n\n\n### Where to go from here\nAt this time Affinicasts is in private beta. I am working hard on authoring content to fill our library of videos and courses. We have created a landing page for at [Affinicasts.com](https://affinicasts.com) which offers a form users can subscribe to in order to be notified when the application launches. I\'m hoping for an early 2018 launch (fingers crossed ðð»).\n\n\n',workImage:{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"1WRXLhS6oUY0CcIcEoGY4A",type:"Asset",createdAt:"2017-11-05T01:06:53.708Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-05T01:06:53.708Z",revision:1,locale:"en-US"},fields:{title:"Affinicasts",file:{url:"//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1WRXLhS6oUY0CcIcEoGY4A/023070b94de085fa5ada26e26fee20f8/Affinicasts.jpg",details:{size:138878,image:{width:1600,height:1200}},fileName:"Affinicasts.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}}},workSeoDescription:"Affinicasts is the home of expert video tutorials and courses showcasing Affinity-Serif products such as Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, and Affinity Publisher."}},{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"5iY9GscVjy0uuSw2oWyYOW",type:"Entry",createdAt:"2017-11-05T01:06:09.815Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-07T01:51:17.648Z",revision:20,contentType:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"ContentType",id:"work"}},locale:"en-US"},fields:{workTitle:"Endlyss Designs",slug:"endlyss-designs",workDescription:'Alyssa Leverenz is a creative business strategist. She approached me with a goal of shifting her business [Endlyss Designs](https://endlyssdesigns.com) into a new direction. On top of strategy, she offers a range of services including but not limited to strategic planning, creative direction, and content management. \n\nShe approached me looking for a new website as the one she had prior had become outdated and depicted her profession as more of a designer rather than a strategist. This shift in focus leads to a new type of website design that wasn\'t based on displaying past work but more so on Alyssa\'s process and offering. To top it off the site links to a dedicated medium blog and features multiple ways to contact her for hire. \n\n### Double duty\nTo streamline my process and also build more content for [Web-Crunch.com](https://web-crunch.com) I decided with Alyssa\'s permission to screencast the entire project. This became a series of 35+ videos of my process from the project kickoff meeting to the final launch of the website. You can view the entire playlist below. If you\'re interested in watching more of my videos be sure to [subscribe to the channel](https://youtube.com/c/webcrunch).\n\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL01nNIgQ4uxOlwziyo5bWrQ1yusSoQZIR" class="embedly-card" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL01nNIgQ4uxOlwziyo5bWrQ1yusSoQZIR</a>\n\n\n### The Ask\nAlyssa was pretty open to creative direction. She gave me free reign to explore everything from branding to content which was a great perk, but I realize in the typical client relationship, freedom isn\'t always so easy to come by. Ultimately, Alyssa was striving for a new place to advertise her services, link back to in blog posts, and offer a new point of entry for new work. Endlyss Designs is a side project to [Couple of Creatives](https://coupleofcreatives.com) which we both co-founded and operate day-to-day. \n\nA kick-off meeting was held that explains what she is striving for in a bit more depth. In the video, we also establish requirements and future plans for the site/project.\n\n<a href="https://youtu.be/3KSzlVevdxE" class="embedly-card" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/3KSzlVevdxE</a>\n\n\n#### Branding\n\nTo kick things off I started with branding. Alyssa had created her own logo which she utilized for roughly five years prior to the redesign/shift. She tasked me with either updating the existing logo or coming up with a new identity altogether. \n\n![endlyssDesigns](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/51nTlR0hxmkcA0MkQ2isSW/a5a974a05a300d609dd736bcab12758f/endlyssDesigns.jpg)\n\nI kept the original symbol for infinity in mind as the word "Endlyss" takes on a double meaning. In this case it means endless possibilities but it is also a play on Alyssa\'s actual name as denoted by the "lyss" characters. \n\nThe infinity symbol does a great job supporting the name so I explored the symbol a bit further and created modified symbols based on the infinity symbol itself. I also experimented with abstract shapes and color that could continue forever based on their pattern and makeup. \n\n#### Style Tiles\n\nI begin all projects with a series of style tiles. A style tile allows me to think atomically in terms of design as well as establish a general look and feel without creating high fidelity mockups. The main take away is to come up with some concepts for styles that we could later base higher fidelity designs of off. This, in the end, saves time as I\'m not fully committing myself to designing full comps that might not even get chosen as final versions.\n\nI am able to establish typography, color, general look and feel, and repeatable components. Buttons, form elements, images, navigation and more are all considered at this time. Below are two different concepts for Endlyss Designs that I came up with.\n\n\n<a class="view-larger" href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1LOTezhPyAAKY0G6ysWWeM/2bde4068b2a228deb89015c8042e7c0f/endlyssDesigns-styletile-1.jpg" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1LOTezhPyAAKY0G6ysWWeM/2bde4068b2a228deb89015c8042e7c0f/endlyssDesigns-styletile-1.jpg" alt="Style title concept 1 for Endlyss Designs project"/>\n</a>\n\n---\n\n\n<a class="view-larger" href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/56v7oVT0GcAQye4aOeSgeM/98aafffec350351d3f26fd6888cff4b1/endlyssDesigns-styletile-2.jpg" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/56v7oVT0GcAQye4aOeSgeM/98aafffec350351d3f26fd6888cff4b1/endlyssDesigns-styletile-2.jpg" alt="Style title concept 2 for Endlyss Designs project"/>\n</a>\n\n\n#### Wireframes / Comps\n\nAfter a meeting with Alyssa, she decided she liked the second style tile the best but was open to either for the new design. Having learned this I began by creating a simple wireframe for the home page and then later two higher fidelity homepage comps to see which direction she was interested in going.\n\nThe home page wireframe:\n\n<a class="view-larger" href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3ZPHYAzQzuAU4GIaScWiyg/194e307c601a3b413ecd7d6ed3ea91cb/endlyssDesigns-wireframe.jpg" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3ZPHYAzQzuAU4GIaScWiyg/194e307c601a3b413ecd7d6ed3ea91cb/endlyssDesigns-wireframe.jpg" alt="Endlyssdesigns.com homepage wireframe" />\n</a>\n\nDue to the small structure of the site, I didn\'t wireframe every page. The homepage was the primary concern to start with. From there, more ideas could either be built with code or along the way as content was being refined.\n\n##### Home Page - Concept 1\nThe first comp is a bit bolder than the next. This uses the same colors Alyssa had used previously on her older version of her logo. The salmon color mixed with a dark shade of gray stood together with a primary background color of white to resemble a loud but confident design. \n\n<a class="view-larger" href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6pbV4EatXiO00GycMms4og/48b9c9a73bade0fe89e2269a8d4b137b/endlyssDesigns-homePage-1.jpg" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6pbV4EatXiO00GycMms4og/48b9c9a73bade0fe89e2269a8d4b137b/endlyssDesigns-homePage-1.jpg" alt="Endlyss Designs Homepage Concept 1"/>\n</a>\n\n---\n\n##### Home Page - Concept 2\nThe second concept won Alyssa over. While it introduced a new color she had never used before she felt it was more balanced and elegant which could potentially yield a better conversion rate for people interested in working with her. \n\n<a class="view-larger" href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4uE2c5U44UsIA8ckK6Y46Q/9918801d6406597079eaf1fb5725de54/endlyssDesigns-homePage-2.jpg" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4uE2c5U44UsIA8ckK6Y46Q/9918801d6406597079eaf1fb5725de54/endlyssDesigns-homePage-2.jpg" alt="Endlyss Designs Homepage Concept 2" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### Services Page\n<a class="view-larger" href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6onZSZ806cwGcWQGqCO466/9ac330b4c2bf7ba7745e23e24cb9be58/endlyssDesigns-services.jpg" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6onZSZ806cwGcWQGqCO466/9ac330b4c2bf7ba7745e23e24cb9be58/endlyssDesigns-services.jpg" alt="Endlyss Designs Services Page Concept" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### Final Site\nYou can view the final site live at [endlyssdesigns.com](https://endlyssdesigns.com). All in all the project was a success. I was able to help Alyssa extend her side project as well as my own blog by recording screencasts of the whole process.

As an avid UX designer myself, I studied the methodologies of other designers and practitioners of the user experience design space. Through this journey, I compiled both my methods and others into a short but thorough eBook. \n\n### What\'s inside?\n\nLUXD covers all the bases of a design process in our modern world including phases of the UX design process and best practices along a designer\'s journey to a UX career. \n\n\n- __Chapter 1__ - Get Inside the Mind of a User\n- __Chapter 2__ - Design Thinking\n- __Chapter 3__ - Design Strategy\n- __Chapter 4__ - Conceptualization & Prototyping\n- __Chapter 5__ - User Research & Validation\n- __Chapter 6__ - UI Design\n- __Chapter 7__ - UX Principles\n- __Chapter 8__ - UX Resources and Links\n- __Bonus: Chapter 9__ -  UX Checklist\n\nI wrote an accompanying [blog post](https://web-crunch.com/luxd-ebook-aspiring-ux-designers/) on to explain the book in further detail over on [Web-Crunch.com](https://web-crunch.com)\n\n\n### More about the book and FAQs\n\n##### Who is the book for?\n\nI created this book for those who want to REALLY learn the user experience design process and have struggled to grasp what the job really entails.\n\nNo matter your knowledge of UX design this book is targeted towards both new and seasoned UX designers.\n\n##### Why should I download your book?\n\nI believe UX design isnât something that can be learned in a classroom but rather from real experiences, even if itâs someone elseâs. I want to share what I know about UX design as well as many methodologies I have used along my path as a UX designer to help you build products people love.\n\nOnline resources try to teach in a very scholarly way, whereas I tend to tell it like it is. These âteachersâ are sometimes not even professionals on the topic at hand, which is pretty lame. They are more interested in the money than giving real information to their students.\n\nMost designers forget that UX design is more about the user than any part of the design itself. The user dictates the way a product can or will evolve. Designers make it work.\n\nSuccessful user experiences keep users coming back for more. To create these you need to understand many aspects of the process all of which are outlined in the book.\n\n##### What formats will it be available in?\n\nThe book is available in PDF and ePub formats.\n\n\n### Interested in getting a copy?\n\n<a href="https://web-crunch.com/books/luxd">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/af2bltQI6IasGm4IM68ue/6f813a69490d0bb2f46c9b83dc88ff59/youtube-cover.jpg" alt="LUXD: Learn User Experience Design" />\n</a>\n\n[Visit the landing page to download your very own copy!](https://web-crunch.com/books/luxd)\n',workImage:{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"7LQHD7K5VueEiCoqgcgmO4",type:"Asset",createdAt:"2017-11-05T01:04:37.253Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-05T01:04:37.253Z",revision:1,locale:"en-US"},fields:{title:"LUXD Feature Image",description:"LUXD Feature Image",file:{url:"//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/7LQHD7K5VueEiCoqgcgmO4/217e03967f8dcdf916246caba7e77bfc/LUXD.jpg",details:{size:266307,image:{width:1600,height:1200}},fileName:"LUXD.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}}},workSeoDescription:"LUXD: Learn User Experience Design is an eBook written by a user experience designer, for user experience designers who want to become successful at what they do."}},{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"7LEflXa8bS8EeCwAskOkms",type:"Entry",createdAt:"2017-11-05T01:02:30.325Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-07T01:52:04.892Z",revision:16,contentType:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"ContentType",id:"work"}},locale:"en-US"},fields:{workTitle:"LinkedIn Redesign",slug:"linkedin-redesign",workDescription:'I wanted to try my hand at a personal case study for an existing big-name social media website.

I wouldn't say I have a \"style\" that I adhere to but I gravitate towards simple shapes and contours in most of my illustration work. I like working with texture inside of my illustrations as well. Affinity Designer also lends me a hand here with its noise filters and various brushes I can apply to my work. This portfolio piece will be a collection of illustrations that I've worked on over the years and doesn't belong to any specific project. \n\n![tanky](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6bN3aQbDMIkwMA24sWYSGg/23a63e29e6e9ba1a66f29206bcad5a26/tanky.png) \n\n![overhead-book](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5fshunlvGM2w6gmUgYK64I/6b946ffd323dceb99ee7a010b6ee5538/overhead-book.jpg) \n\n![oven](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5bV1fp0GiQage4OGiqQgGM/7c123d58eb0a907410ee97adb358e216/oven.jpg) \n\n![polycow](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6ZmUdUBsisa4a2k8Ue0sqy/28a69a88392b20039bee85d3fba52fec/polycow.png) \n\n![ah dribbble](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4qPIuBG9BKgMQ26g04cGES/0fc49c691132db8f6e8d27ad775f7c54/ah_dribbble.jpg) \n\n![service-icons](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4clwdZNN7OsmQqcMccaYqC/c2139be19909912c3f8c619fb4b116f3/service-icons.jpg)\n\n![cannabis-farm](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1YlHuN6UcIAySGcMgiQaYo/5423c8a668db9ac489b685e9ad7f18c4/cannabis-farm.jpg) \n\n![folderexploration](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/71Z80fi47YaiSumYKAwaas/8ba1cb659bab468924af9fa79d40ca2c/folderexploration.png) \n\n\n![fridge](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/401TPvESxaC0SOqoi0Q8Wa/2382603b5fa3173cbf50b1442a000417/fridge.jpg) \n\n![butterfly](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3Pze2vhaDCeaqMaE22oCUC/8d129baeb53d3d81432e31a2264f3ea0/butterfly.jpg) \n\n![onthefarm](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4ldBfLaatysUOqq8iKw8ig/2fac79158de9334bba6b7ebd48b4ffa9/onthefarm.png)\n\n![affinicasts-feature-art](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3lXCFvLl7amwIaIQ26qewG/4b4a658bc71a2363e1e63b58439df7ea/affinicasts-feature-art.jpg) \n\n![affinicasts-bear](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4TJuYrGv9CqyiiOcgKqosG/50a7ce5146771965d24f5772b7e5d345/affinicasts-bear.jpg) \n\n![affinicasts-dog](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/49TsEsvfG0qkikuugEsMuS/5e401eceec796a14ca29735df5fa34f7/affinicasts-dog.jpg) \n\n![affinicasts-monkey](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1ZZZ8WE7xa42eCQqgoSAEQ/439c00d0f8c43bff26985b7c99e08755/affinicasts-monkey.jpg)\n\n",workImage:{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"1DujhCVSoMwo8MKaUg6uAE",type:"Asset",createdAt:"2017-11-05T01:01:16.631Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-05T01:01:16.631Z",revision:1,locale:"en-US"},fields:{title:"Illustrations of Andy Leverenz",description:"A collection of illustration work ",file:{url:"//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1DujhCVSoMwo8MKaUg6uAE/3985117154cf81c31dc592fc84c32f11/Illustrations.jpg",details:{size:352295,image:{width:1600,height:1200}},fileName:"Illustrations.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}}},workSeoDescription:"Some of my work calls for custom illustrations.

To accommodate their vision, they built a new and improved campus and approached us in search for a digital marketing revamp including a brand new website.\n\nThe church was looking for a website that featured more engaging content and carried over their new bold branding. They also had a variety of problems with their current website which limited their ability to publish frequent updates on their own. My job was to both design a newly branded website as well as offer the ability for the team to make updates at their leisure.\n\n### The starting point\n![harvester-home-old-site](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1A4D4FSByM2WmwiWWqggOQ/36142438ca214992731b42521e01e7d6/harvester-home-old-site.jpg)\n\nMuch of Harvester\'s previous design was repetitive and didn\'t have great scalability out of the box. A lot of content was even hardcoded even though it was built on WordPress. \n\n### The Rebrand & New Campus\n![new-building-interior](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6vJlWS5Sj6yiAG6Kyie6gc/4f53d8b4f7f66811a9cd7c32c80ccdd2/new-building-interior.jpg)\n\nA new campus being built ultimately inspired the new website design. I was tasked to capture the already existing branding put in place and incorporate it into the website. I was given everything from building plans, to interior design plans to help with my efforts. There was a focus on bold typography mixed with muted but bold colors throughout. Wood grain, steel, and minimalism was a big focus. Having been shown all of the materials and styles already in place I was able to create a style tile. This is usually one of the first design-based steps of my process in which I establish a foundation for styles, typography, branding, and repeatable elements within a website.\n\n#### Style Tile\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1jZAsd7nemqG62Om8GGk8k/1e7a66461f4658bcb996aa818027e634/harvester-styleguide.png" class="view-larger" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1jZAsd7nemqG62Om8GGk8k/1e7a66461f4658bcb996aa818027e634/harvester-styleguide.png" alt="harvester christian style tile" />\n</a>\n\nOne prominent color I introduced was a bold blue color for secondary based actions. Ultimately this color was used fairly heavily as it indicated an action item right away. Buttons, for instance, stood out a great deal better in this blue rather than the primary color of Harvester\'s already chosen green color. \n\nThe [Gotham font family](https://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/) from [Hoefler & Co](https://typography.com) was used exclusively throughout the site in various weights. Gotham Black, for instance, was used for primary leveled headings whereas Gotham Regular was used for body copy.\n\n#### Inspiration Board\nAside from a style tile I created an inspiration board which combined textures, photography, color, and typography to give myself and the team at the church insight into what style the site would likely uphold.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/rqdWeQ3s8SagOQOWyis0G/d734ce8ef39301f230bc8b110715a779/inspiration-board.jpg" class="view-larger" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/rqdWeQ3s8SagOQOWyis0G/d734ce8ef39301f230bc8b110715a779/inspiration-board.jpg" alt="harvester christian inspiration board" />\n</a>\n\n### Design Phase\nAfter deciding on a style to head Harvester requested to see a few ideas for the homepage before committing. Typically at this phase I start with wireframes but due to some time contraints and some requests from the team I opted in to designing a few ideas first. The final concept after about three rounds was a photo rich idea that sectioned off different points of entry to parts of the website.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3il7I8kGTmq8m6kaweEwIo/aaa29aa48324ed297f241c0542e89db2/home-static-menu.jpg" class="view-larger" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3il7I8kGTmq8m6kaweEwIo/aaa29aa48324ed297f241c0542e89db2/home-static-menu.jpg" alt="chosen home page concept" />\n</a>\n\nUltimately the hero portion of the home page would be a short looped video as the background image. The team also cut down on the sectioned points of entry and added a video and form at the bottom for increased conversions for new members. \n\nThe design today reflects this as shown below:\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/39K5mT7pO84MGkiUmgyuqK/4bdfe00f19e74619211abea43422b78c/harvester-home.jpg" class="view-larger" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/39K5mT7pO84MGkiUmgyuqK/4bdfe00f19e74619211abea43422b78c/harvester-home.jpg" alt="the home page today" />\n</a>\n\n#### Interior pages\nAfter furthering in the design phase I began thinking in terms of scalability. There were a few basic templates used throughout that were both engaging and easily configurable by the team. \n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5J9sg0KL2ECK6SAK6w8KIQ/f9845646c8f0f874ac10cd680737061d/harvester-missions.jpg" class="view-larger" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5J9sg0KL2ECK6SAK6w8KIQ/f9845646c8f0f874ac10cd680737061d/harvester-missions.jpg" alt="harvester christian church missions page" />\n</a>\n\n### Fully responsive \n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3V6cBJFpSUEC6u282QYQM4/b280b15c16d0c5d11645efc395fc70fc/harvester-responsive.jpg" class="view-larger" target="_blank">\n<img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3V6cBJFpSUEC6u282QYQM4/b280b15c16d0c5d11645efc395fc70fc/harvester-responsive.jpg" alt="harvester christian church responsive design" />\n</a>\nI provided support for the website on all mobile devices. The mobile design features a fixed header and navigation available with a single tap of your finger. This promotes better user experience and ultimately a more pleasant browing experience for nealy 5,000 vistors per day. \n\nThe collaboration process with Harvester Christian was a rewarding experience. I actually live just minutes from the church, so I found it fullfilling to support our community within such close range.\n\n\nIf you are interested in checking out what Harvester has to offer, be sure to check out their website at [harvesterchristian.org](http://harvesterchristian.org).\n\n\n\n\n',workImage:{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"jTz5YfUaJ2oos0MAskcKA",type:"Asset",createdAt:"2017-11-05T00:56:44.401Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-05T00:56:44.401Z",revision:1,locale:"en-US"},fields:{title:"Harvester Christian Chruch Feature Image",description:"",file:{url:"//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/jTz5YfUaJ2oos0MAskcKA/ba67d8c8a0da7243ebf877a6ca9b869a/HarvesterChristian.jpg",details:{size:374135,image:{width:1600,height:1200}},fileName:"HarvesterChristian.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}}},workSeoDescription:"Harvester Christian Church was on a mission to grow their staff, attendance and overall presence in their local community.

Some time ago I asked myself: \n\n> "What if marketing services could be a monthly installment similar to a SaaS application?" \n\nThis very question led my partner(now wife) and me into a period of discovery about a new model of doing business for our agency [Couple of Creatives](https://coupleofcreatives.com).\n\n### The Problem\nHaving read a book called *The Marketing Agency Blueprint* by Paul Roetzer, I was heavily inspired to adopt a new approach to pricing our services and how we offered help to new prospects at Couple of Creatives. Roetzer owns a hybrid pr agency that uses a completely different billing model similar to a SaaS web application. There are different tiers of offerings for different fees. Customers can pick and choose their services all while being charged for the tier alotted to them.\n\nThe problem that stood before my agency was the unwillingness of clients to disclose their budgets. Having no insight on what some clients could and could not afford made it incredibly difficult to generate accurate estimates. This often resulted in a lot of time spent creating proposals just to be turned down by a client unwilling to accept our rate. It\'s nobody\'s fault. I too would be hesitant to disclose how much I can afford versus how much I\'m willing to spend on things. We sought after a new way to make this process less painful. \n\n### Our Proposed Solution\nWith proposals being generated and turned down over and over I took some time to assess the pain points we were having and started to borrow from the ideas from Roetzer about developing hybrid marketing agency using the SaaS model. Why not offer services at a set rate for a reoccurring feed? Combine the set rate with a series of credits for each "plan" and both sides win.\n\n### Why stop there. Could this be a real app?\nAs I began writing down my thoughts and thinking about the new model more and more, I realized that this entire model could be wrapped around an actual application that scales. What if the marketing team behind the scenes was a series of marketing teams who were on call to deliver services to customers who signed up for a recurring plan through the application itself? This got my blood pumping. Our thought was that the application would be a place customers can go to get marketing services in an ongoing fashion using different tiers of offerings at different rates. The same is true for marketing agencies. What if they could use the application to find clients?\n\nSo as you can see I took all this into account and began thinking first about how we can make this work for our agency but also at the same time trying to think **bigger** where we build an application that delivers services to customers and clients to agencies in a SaaS-based way.\n\n#### Sketching\nTo wrap my head around the new model we were proposing I needed to write down my thoughts in a more organized manner. I took to a blank markdown document inside of [Notion](https://notion.so) (our project management app of choice at the time) and just began pouring out ideas on how to make this work. I covered a lot of details about how the architecture would be laid out, what type of plans would be available, and each plans pricing. \n\n![Notion screenshot of SaaS-based Marketing App](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4KhaWgOWs0Y8CW2OK0CWmg/6d39081ee872a3492a005a1c01fad134/notion.png)\n\nMy version of sketching boils down to making lists and organizing our features. The general document began with this list of subsidiary documents outlining specific parts of our hybrid approach which we called "SaaS-based Marketing".\n\n+ __General Notes__ \n+ __Summary__ - *What is the point of this? What problems are we solving and why?*\n+ __Monetization__ - *If this model becomes an application how do we monetize in the long run and scale?*\n+ __Onboarding__ - *Sketching ideas on how to Onboard new customers/clients*\n+ __Internal__ - *What we should manage and what we could have others manage*\n+ __Services Offered__ - *What exactly would we offer and what tier would it be available in?*\n+ __Packaging Plans + Pricing__ - *How many plans do we offer? What price is fair but also competitive?*\n+ __Similar Applications__ - *How do we stand out in the market?*\n+ __New Hires__ - *To scale we need more manpower*\n\n### User Flows\nAfter some internal discussions and exploration, I took things one step further and dived into developing what would be a "configuration" wizard to qualify clients for a certain tier of pricing. This wizard would be a series of questions the client would answer that dictate the best path for them to take in getting the best services from both the application and those involved in exchanging the service. I took to [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) to create a user story flow chart.\n\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6HBYFbSvaEmmuOYiyeI2wm/443f83fc9cdfa91fc870b04cff61209f/onboarding-diagram.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6HBYFbSvaEmmuOYiyeI2wm/443f83fc9cdfa91fc870b04cff61209f/onboarding-diagram.jpg" alt="SaaS Marketing Application User Onboarding Diagram"/></a>\n\n\nThe configuration wizard would ask foundational questions like:\n\n+ Do you have a logo?\n+ Do you have an existing website?\n+ What services are you looking for? \n\nFrom questions like these led to more detailed questions which could later be expanded upon as the application/process grew. The ultimate goal for the wizard was to do some of the work for both us and the customer so it was easier to decide what package to select in order to fulfill their needs while also saving time. \n\n### Starting small\n\nTo actually test the concept, we started small by using a toned down version of this concept which was two parts. \n\n1. The customer selects the plan that works the best for them. We personally offer assistance in this process so they select the best tier.\n2.  Supplies personal information then submits their selection(s) and personal information to us using a custom form we created.\n\nThe design for this concept was live on our site for some time. We called it the pricing page just like a typical app-based website. The first part is shown below:\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/2Y7R1uSrvWKUEY204kqSQ2/6e3d338a78e51857e1a7aca9809cb5a5/pricing.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/2Y7R1uSrvWKUEY204kqSQ2/6e3d338a78e51857e1a7aca9809cb5a5/pricing.jpg" alt="Pricing Page High Fidelity Design"/></a>\n\nThe final design mimics the image above. The user can pick and choose options from each pack thus creating their own "plan". We didn\'t want to limit a user to a tier because they were based on specific services and offerings. Rather than force them we opted to let them configure their own path. Those selections then later allowed us to configure a price based on their selections. \n\nThe second part is a simple personal information form:\n\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5mOF2tVWhyi2sqo6q6iw6e/af091e0c89cdef569c9041f301bcd0f5/pricing_part_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5mOF2tVWhyi2sqo6q6iw6e/af091e0c89cdef569c9041f301bcd0f5/pricing_part_2.jpg" alt="Second part of the pricing form for Couple of Creative\'s website" /></a>\n\nOnce the necessary data is entered the user submits the form and both they and we get an email with their choices. \n\nI built this form from scratch using `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It worked both for desktop and mobile devices.\n\n### Expanding on the application idea\nWith our toned down version in place, I continued exploring the concept of making this concept a full-fledged application. To help with the idea I began designing wireframes. We landed on a temporary name for the application which was **makeyourmark.io** but it is still a work in progress.\n\nHere are a series of wireframes to give you a sense of where it could go.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5f6Nqc8yCck6umicEQIO2S/3c2cf824ff9a3fb0e0fb8626948d9d48/wires-landing-page.jpg" target="_blank" title="A potential SaaS Marketing App Home Page Wireframe"><img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5f6Nqc8yCck6umicEQIO2S/3c2cf824ff9a3fb0e0fb8626948d9d48/wires-landing-page.jpg" alt="A potential SaaS Marketing App Home Page Wireframe"/></a>\n\n#### Wizard Concepts\nThe wizard would be an in-between step from a user actually committing to a plan/package. Ultimately as I described before, it would save time, effort, and better access a clients "needs", "wants", and "nice to haves."\n![wizard-start](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/3ionrUWqbY2s80EwaSmeMA/6e3d338a78e51857e1a7aca9809cb5a5/wizard-start.jpg) \n\n---\n\n\n![wizard-basic-question](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/1xLzdMhJGQqK8gY4GIgGI6/53348b822f60162fdd6793772ae3c105/wizard-basic-question.jpg)\n\n#### Dashboard Concept\nA user who is on an active plan would have a dashboard page similar to this. Each customer has an appointed marketing contact as well as the ability to see the project progress, interact with the marketing team, and much more.\n\n<a href="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/43rgCodPK8sOgu2CkCQogS/0c200aa746e5513ff9d368722c87fcc6/dashboard-landing.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/43rgCodPK8sOgu2CkCQogS/0c200aa746e5513ff9d368722c87fcc6/dashboard-landing.jpg" alt="A Dashboard concept of a user account inside the SaaS Marketing App"/></a>\n\n\n## Results\nThe SaaS-based marketing concept is still in force for my agency. We are still a new agency and are growing but we plan to try and pivot the way service-based work like design, SEO, PR and more is done with a more recurring model. This means more affordable marketing and a team customers can depend upon so long as their plan is active. A big problem is the perception of most people looking for work. Many assume by default we have an hourly rate and/or will quote a flat rate for work. This also becomes an issue for clients who only need a very small amount of work performed.\n\n##### Issues\nAs with anything, there are some bugs to work out. For instance, what if a customer just needs a one-time project and not recurring work? Our answer to that is still up for debate. Do we offer alternative flat-rate quotes or only take in recurring clientele? \n\nAnother issue is making sure there aren\'t issues of scope creep. Billing at a set monthly, quarterly, or annual rate has its perks but what if more or less work comes down the line. Do we offer credits in lieu of monthly rates which limit the type of work we perform? This question too is still up for debate.\n\n##### Building the application\nAs of today, the application is still a concept. I do plan to continue the concept and possibly build a prototype for the sake of testing our theories on building a full SaaS application with marketing services as it\'s core model. \n\n',workImage:{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"4Nf4xiKMJWu6YaauucqYOs",type:"Asset",createdAt:"2017-11-05T00:55:18.924Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-05T00:55:18.924Z",revision:1,locale:"en-US"},fields:{title:"SaaS Marketing App Feature Image",description:"Screenshot of the pricing model and columns at Coupleofcreatives.com",file:{url:"//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4Nf4xiKMJWu6YaauucqYOs/ac078bfa1b4d56fa26e35502589693a7/Onboarding_User_COC.jpg",details:{size:238227,image:{width:1600,height:1200}},fileName:"Onboarding User COC.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}}},workSeoDescription:"What if marketing services could be a monthly installment similar to a SaaS application?

That website is known as [Web-Crunch.com](https://web-crunch.com)\n\nWeb-Crunch is a place where designers, developers and entrepreneurs come together and share insight on their profession. We lead the discussion offering new articles and content each and every week for absolutely free. Why would we do such a thing?\n\nWell, itâs simple really. I enjoy it. Many bloggers are born this way. Think of a blog as a public journal. We use it as an outlet to learn new things, share insight with others, learn and of course, cross-promote. I even write [books](https://web-crunch.com/all-products/) ;).\n\n### Video Walkthrough\n\nBelow is a video overview of the newly redesigned Web-Crunch.com where Andy walks you through his process and some of the design decisions we utilized throughout.\n\n<a href="https://youtu.be/kJUvb0rj3tc" class="embedly-card" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/kJUvb0rj3tc</a>\n\n\n### Why Web-Crunch? \n\nIt all began as a side project. I was working full-time as a UX designer for a startup company and was already writing for some design and development blogs such as [Elegant Themes](http://elegantthemes.com/), [Web Designer Depot](http://webdesignerdepot.com/), and [Specky Boy](http://speckyboy.com/) on the side. I really enjoyed the experience writing for these bigger blogs but decided to contribute towards a publication of his own. Thus, Web-Crunch was born.\n\n### The Original Design\n\nWeb-Crunch is only a few years old and has only had one recent makeover. The original design was a colorful take on articles about branding, web design, web development, freelancing and design as a whole. You can see screenshots of the old design below. I considered the design to be a valid effort but learned along the way began to feel messy and constrained for future growth.\n\n![old-home-page](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/2QxIyI2R5YKqQoiWgmC802/1881e34d9e0bd74c602925a56768fe32/old-home-page.jpg)\n\nThe old home page served its purpose but was crowded and unoptimized. Small things were amiss all over the site which prompted our push for a fresh redesign.\n\n![old-category-page](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/7i0hl4YOdO26y4u8a8U6Sm/ee5f62db2e2b3ee99a411305f635a681/old-category-page.jpg)\n\nAn individual article page presented itself in a 3 column layout where the main content was centered on the page. Larger margins made each article easier to read but the design of the page itself was rather loud and needed to be cleaned up.\n\n### The Redesign\n\nAfter about two years with the first design, we decided it was time to redesign and optimize the website. Not only did the look and feel change, but so did the code underneath.\n\nThe new design at first glance is quite minimal. I decided this time around to focus more on the content rather than the appearance of the site.\n\nMuch of the site architecture and pages remained intact but the experience you now see live on the site was altered to improve the most important thing: __readability__.\n\n![new-home-page](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/n5LJvrE6WcUm0yQmYGUmI/ed9512e941770dfd676aff895964e96f/new-home-page.jpg)\n\n##### Home Page\n\nAfter reading a column in a physical newspaper, I was inspired to mimic the general layout of a newspaper publication and utilize a pretty rigid grid with columns on the home page. This page is the home for the most recent articles that get published on Web-Crunch.com. You can paginate through them all or visit the [archives page](https://web-crunch.com/archives/) to see the entire article history to date.\n\n![new-category-page](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/TZeSibQAACU8UK4uCwqYs/ff57a56889e957ddd7c7cbe75f24d4b9/new-category-page.jpg)\n\n##### Category Page\n\nEach category archive page still retains its original color scheme used on the previous design though this time it is much less prominent. You can preview each color scheme by using the main navigation. Once clicked and active the category item in the menu activates a colored border on the bottom of the element and the body of the category archive page has a very subtle gradient within the background.\n\n![new-article-page](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/6pESMNuMLKKekmKUo0imK6/abff5ee7fed11b457b7bdb178fa24235/new-article-page.jpg)\n\n##### The Article Page\n\nThe article page is obviously where you are going to do most of your reading when on the site. More often than not most users will be linked directly to each article rather than a category page or the home page. With that in mind, we omitted the sidebar that existed previously on the old design. Large margins are enforced here to offer increased readability and things are just more neat and tidy which was our goal from the start.\n\n![new-books-design](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/5G4Ot5QqTSSuc0g44aQuMu/108edc4a79c383846ace239616e3324c/new-books-design.jpg)\n\n##### The Products/Books Page\n\nHaving written [Pro Tumblr Theming](https://web-crunch.com/books/ptt) and currently writing [LUXD: Learn User Experience Design](https://web-crunch.com/books/luxd), I needed a better place to promote these products. With that in mind, a new page was born.\n\n### Color\n![colors](//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/7LH9eInnxKEAIEsaqoqAwu/f48f563217cd3edcbfa5adcc0e6f44d4/colors.jpg)\n\nI used a simple color palette when designing Web-Crunch.com. What was once loud, bright and bold colors turned into about 3 primary colors used throughout the entire site. Most of what you see is simply black and white and that is on purpose.\n\n#### Typography\n\nTypography was the star of the show in our opinion. We used a combination of sans-serif and serif typefaces to keep the look modern but most importantly easy to read.\n\nFor the main body font, we used [Mercury Text](http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-text/overview/) from [Hoefler & Co.](http://www.typography.com/) It was recommended that this typeface is used for larger font sizes and headings as opposed to body fonts but through some trial and error.\n\nFor almost all of the headings, we made use of a free @font-face font from [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) called [Franklin Gothic FS](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/franklin-gothic-fs) which comes in four styles(for free).\n\nPairing *Franklin Gothic FS* with *Mercury Text* worked nicely. We went through a lot of different options and nearly settled on system fonts like Georgia and Arial but I decided these were a bit more for us.\n\n#### Code \n\nI used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), a content management system, to build Web-Cruch.com. WordPress is written in `PHP`. The theme prior to this made use of the same language with a few custom post types and custom fields. With the new design, we decided to give [Timber](http://upstatement.com/timber/) a shot. Timber simplifies a lot of age-old WordPress PHP code you probably loathe if youâre familiar. Your PHP files still exist (the logic) and new template files authored in [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (HTML) format present the data. At the end of the day, we really liked using Timber and will likely continue to do so for most WordPress based websites we build.\n\nTimber combined with Twig clean up your code tremendously. Andy ran into a few hiccups tying every bit of functionality into WordPress but luckily you can still use some of the original WordPress `PHP` functionality within your theme if you have to.\n\n#### Bootstrap / Frameworks\n\nOn the old design, I used CSS/Sass from scratch and essentially created our own CSS framework. During this time, we considered Bootstrap (a modern CSS framework) a cop out for a modern day developer. Our opinion two years ago was that the framework was bulky in terms of all that CSS to load and not even make use of. Luckily today, you can configure an optimized version for your own purposes or just load it from a CDN.\n\nWhile creating your own framework allows you to try and be lean, many styles wound up missing for various elements later down the line that we didnât account for. This meant ongoing work to get things to look and function correctly. Given the lack of time, we seem to always have, we couldnât always make necessary ongoing enhancements.\n\nWith all that behind us, we decided to make use of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the redesign. This was done for a variety of reasons but mostly because the framework is tested and contributed towards by many talented individuals. Their experience and skills have made Bootstrap a longstanding and highly adaptive framework no matter the device or location you view it from. We defined our own theme and some custom styles but bootstrap has our back for the remainder of the site design. It just works! Luckily with Bootstrap, you can pick and choose what CSS to make use of. With that in mind, I only used a few components to cut down on slow page load speeds.\n\n#### Challenges and Successes\n\nBelow are summarized challenges and success that were made with the redesign. Itâs hard to tell if the design is a crowd favorite just yet but I think the concept of putting the content forward was executed well and are pleased with how it turned out.\n\n\n- If youâre pressed for time, use what you know to solve the problem at hand.\n- We didnât need massive images or funky colors to prove a point.\n- The new design is way more optimized and consistent than the old one. We feel positive about the new design whereas the old one was beginning to make me cringe.\n- Even though it took longer than we hoped we were able to redesign the site while working full time on other projects.\n- I learned a new framework and kept the codebase extremely clean and clear to read. This means I can scale at ease.\n- I added a new dedicated products landing page so we have a home for future products. This also encourages us to brainstorm new ideas.\n- Thereâs now a video category and video will become a big focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n',workImage:{sys:{space:{sys:{type:"Link",linkType:"Space",id:"nubzmdwueyfj"}},id:"4TrFZT3Un6uiKAQsoEgCUe",type:"Asset",createdAt:"2017-11-05T01:09:33.421Z",updatedAt:"2017-11-05T01:09:33.421Z",revision:1,locale:"en-US"},fields:{title:"Web-Crunch.com",file:{url:"//images.contentful.com/nubzmdwueyfj/4TrFZT3Un6uiKAQsoEgCUe/4703930650900614d6ecd9c70addcdff/webcrunch.jpg",details:{size:179809,image:{width:1600,height:1200}},fileName:"webcrunch.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}}},workSeoDescription:"December 2014, a new website was born which would become a home for my thoughts and ideas that relate directly to my creative professions and interests.
